# 🧪 Research Projects Repository

## 📚 Purpose

This GitHub organization aims to centralize and organize all materials related to our research projects, including:

- Source code  
- Academic papers and reports  
- References and supporting materials  
- Processed and raw results

Each project will be maintained in a **dedicated repository** to prevent merge conflicts and ensure clean collaboration among team members.
